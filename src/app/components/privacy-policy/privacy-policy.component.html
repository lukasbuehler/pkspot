  <h1>PK Spot - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last Updated: 4. December 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how PK Spot
    ("we," "us," "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The person responsible for data processing on this website (the
    "controller") is Lukas Bühler.
    <br />
    Full contact details required under data protection law are available on our
    <a routerLink="/impressum">Impressum</a> page.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
  <p>We collect and process data in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>When you create an account or post content:</strong> We collect
      personal data you provide, such as your username and email address, to
      manage your account and display your content.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When you visit our website:</strong> We automatically collect
      technical data (e.g., IP address, browser type) for security and
      operational purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When you interact with specific features:</strong> Services like
      our interactive maps require processing of technical data to function.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>We process your data based on the following legal grounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> To provide the services you
      request when you create an account (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To ensure the security and
      functionality of our website, analyze traffic with privacy-respecting
      tools, and protect against spam (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). In particular, we use
      <strong>PostHog Analytics</strong> on the basis of our legitimate
      interests in measuring the reach and performance of our website and in
      improving the user experience. PostHog is configured with privacy-friendly
      settings: we use the EU data center (eu.i.posthog.com), respect the
      browser's "Do Not Track" setting, use localStorage instead of cookies, and
      only create person profiles for identified (logged-in) users. You can
      object to processing based on legitimate interests at any time by
      contacting us (see Impressum). If your browser or device blocks analytics
      or has strict tracking prevention enabled, we respect that.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consent:</strong> When you agree to our terms and policies upon
      visiting the site for the first time (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cookies, Local Storage, and Third-Party Services</h2>
